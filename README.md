# Perfect Square Root Finder in C

This is a straightforward C program that determines whether a given integer is a perfect square.

## How it works

- The program loops from 1 up to half of the input number.
- For each number `i`, it checks if `i * i` equals the input.
- If a match is found, it prints the square root and stops.
- If no match is found, it tells you the number is not a perfect square.

## Example
Input: 36
Output: Square root is: 6

Input: 33
Output: Is not a perfect square
