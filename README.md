# Perfect Square Root Finder in C

This is a straightforward C program that determines whether a given integer is a perfect square.

## How it works

- The program loops from 1 up to half of the input number.
- For each number `i`, it checks if `i * i` equals the input.
- If a match is found, it prints the square root and stops.
- If no match is found, it tells you the number is not a perfect square.

## Example
```
Enter your value: 36
Square root is: 6

Enter your value: 33
Its not a perfect square!
```
